# ZanLing-TrueZero
A Python chess engine that starts from Zero. This project is still very much work-in-progress.

## About the Engine
The name of the Engine is Zan1Ling4, which is taken from 真零, which is Chinese for "True Zero" and romanised using [Jyutping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jyutping) for Cantonese. 

Instead of being hard-coded by humans, this AI learns how to play through playing games from itself and learning from randomly generated games. 

The evaluation learns from randomly generated games with outcomes and move turn and based on move turn and final outcome, assign a score between 1/0/-1 for games that were won/lost/drew respectively, accounting for move turn. 

The chess Engine will then play games against itself using the evaluation to evalutate chess positions, done using [Negamax with Alpha Beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax#Negamax_with_alpha_beta_pruning).

## How all this works in more detail
The Evaluation AI is trained on a SQL database* containing games that were previously played by humans on [Lichess](lichess.com) (taken [here](https://database.lichess.org/)). The AI is then trained on 20 randomly selected board states of each game, given nothing (no prerequisite knowledge) but the board state (after one-hot encoding) and turn to move (and nothing else) to predict final outcome, with 1,0 and -1 denoting a winning, an equal outcome (draw) and a losing game for relative to side to move. This regression model is then fed to the Engine, where it looks for optimal moves using Negamax with Alpha Beta Pruning, giving an evaluation for each position.

## What each file does
- `ai5.pyx` - used for internal testing, not a UCI compliant way of running the Engine
- `aiuci.py` - UCI compliant, contains the logic for handling UCI commands
- `main.py` - run this file for the "work-in-progress" experience of the UCI Engine
- `aiucieval.py` - UCI compliant version of the code that handles move search and evaluation
- `aieval6.pyx` - used for training the evaluation AI. Handles SQL data accessing and one-hot encoding as well

## Libraries/technologies used
This Python Engine uses the following:
- **Pytorch** - used for creating NN
- **Numpy** - used for processing data (chess board representation after one-hot encoding, handling final outcome and final game result
- **Scikitlearn** - used minimally for splitting data into train/validation sets (will be replaced with Pytorch DataLoader in the future)
- **Python Chess** - used for handling board-related code
- **Cython** - used for running files at faster speeds instead of running on Vanilla Python
- **Setuptools** - used in tandem with Cython to Cythonise the Python code
- **SQLite3** - used for writing/accessing data to the SQL database
